# Certura Internship - C Programming Tasks

This repository contains C programming tasks completed during my **virtual internship at Certura**. Each program demonstrates problem-solving, file handling, and algorithmic logic in C.

## 📘 Task 1: Library Management System (`task1.c`)

A console-based library system that allows:
- Adding books  
- Deleting books  
- Searching books by ISBN  
- Displaying all books  

Data is stored in a file (`library.txt`) so it persists between runs.

## 🔐 Task 2: Vigenère Cipher Tool (`task2.c`)

A simple encryption and decryption program using the **Vigenère Cipher**.  

Features:
- User inputs a secret key and message  
- Program encrypts the message  
- Then decrypts back to original

## ➗ Task 3: Quadratic Equation Solver (`task3.c`)

A program that solves quadratic equations of the form:

ax^2 + bx + c = 0


Handles:
- Two distinct real roots  
- One real repeated root  
- Complex roots
